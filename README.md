# Self Driving Car with Javascript
This repository contains the code that was developed during the Self-driving car (no libraries) JavaScript course.

## Overview
The code is organized into nine parts, each corresponding to a specific topic in the course. The parts are as follows:

- Car driving mechanics: This part focuses on implementing the basic mechanics for the car to move and turn.

- Road definition: Here, the road is defined and its boundaries are set. This allows the car to stay on the road while driving.
- Artificial sensors: Artificial sensors are added to the car, allowing it to "see" the road ahead and avoid obstacles.
- Collision detection: In this part, collision detection is implemented so that the car can detect and avoid obstacles.
- Traffic simulation: Traffic is simulated so that the car can interact with other cars on the road.
- Neural network: A neural network is created to train the car to drive itself.
- Visualizing neural networks: The neural network is visualized so that it can be analyzed and optimized.
- Optimizing neural networks: The neural network is optimized to improve the car's driving performance.
- Fine-tuning: Finally, the car is fine-tuned to achieve optimal driving performance.

## Usage

*To use the code, simply clone this repository to your local machine and open the relevant part in your preferred code editor. Each part is self-contained, so you can work on them independently. Detailed instructions are provided in each part's README file.*
